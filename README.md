Tutorial for a Page Object Pattern

This is a demo project made while reading:
http://kainos.pl/blog/building-automation-framework-by-example-1-the-first-tests/
https://www.kainos.pl/blog/building-test-automation-framework-by-example-2-page-object-pattern/

It needs to be improved (for example delete Thread.sleep)

There are two tests:
1. testAddingItemToCard - without Page Object Pattern
2. testAddingToTheCard - with Page Object Pattern
so you can compare both methods.
